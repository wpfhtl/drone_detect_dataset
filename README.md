### "test_drone_list.txt" is the list for the testing images.
### One folder is "JPEGImages", consisting of the images. The image is generated by fusing a background image with a foreground drone.
### The other folder is "labels", consisting of the labels. The label is as the format of YOLO, that is (object id, center x, center y, width, height), in this dataset, the (object id) is always 0. The name of the label is corresponding the name of image except the postfix.
